# CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

This repository contains my projects for Harvard University's CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course.

## Course Description

This course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine learning. The course covers various aspects of AI like search algorithms, knowledge representation, neural networks, and machine learning.

## What I've Learned

- Search Algorithms: Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, A* Search
- Knowledge Representation: Propositional and First-Order Logic
- Reasoning Algorithms: Model Checking, Resolution
- Neural Networks: Perceptrons, Backpropagation
- Machine Learning: k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Random Forests
- Natural Language Processing: Syntax and Parsing, Part-of-Speech Tagging, Named Entity Recognition
- Computer Vision: Image Recognition, Object Detection
- Reinforcement Learning: Q-Learning, Policy Gradients
