# Crossword Creator

Crossword Creator is a Python application designed to solve crossword puzzles by assigning words to crossword variables satisfying all constraints of unary (length of word) and binary (overlap between words) nature.

## Overview

This application consists of two main Python classes, namely `Variable` and `Crossword`, along with a `CrosswordCreator` class to solve the crossword puzzle.

## Learning Outcomes

### 1. **Understanding of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)**
   Through the creation and solution of crossword puzzles, I gained insights into how CSPs work, learning how to define variables, domains, and constraints to represent a problem in a structured manner.

### 2. **Binary and Unary Constraints**
   By ensuring the assigned words meet the length and overlap requirements, I experienced firsthand the application of unary and binary constraints, two fundamental concepts in CSPs.

### 3. **Application of Machine Learning Principles**
   This project is a portrayal of machine learning principles, such as defining constraints and searching through a solution space, to find a solution that satisfies all imposed constraints, reflecting the essence of machine learning methodologies.

### 4. **Enhanced Problem-Solving Skills**
   Designing an application that assigns words to crossword variables enhanced my problem-solving skills, pushing me to think critically about defining and solving problems efficiently.

## Demonstrations in Machine Learning

### 1. **Algorithm Efficiency**
   The efficiency of the algorithms used in solving the CSPs in this project is crucial. It demonstrated how the choice and implementation of algorithms directly impact the performance and efficiency of a machine learning model.

### 2. **Data Structuring and Representation**
   Representing the crossword as structured data and defining variables and constraints are pivotal. It highlighted the importance of properly structuring and representing data in machine learning tasks.

### 3. **Solution Space Exploration**
   The method of exploring different possible assignments to find a solution that satisfies all constraints showcased how machine learning models explore the solution space to make predictions or decisions.

### 4. **Practical Application of Theoretical Concepts**
   Implementing a crossword solver allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge of CSPs and machine learning in a practical, real-world scenario, reinforcing the learned concepts.
