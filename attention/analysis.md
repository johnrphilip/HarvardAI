## Layer TODO, Head TODO

TODO

Example Sentences:
- TODO
- TODO

For each "## Layer TODO, Head TODO" section, you should replace "TODO" with the actual layer and head number you are analyzing. For example, if you are analyzing the attention diagrams of Layer 1, Head 2, you would write "## Layer 1, Head 2".

Under each section, you should write your observations and analysis where it says "TODO" under the layer and head number. This is where you describe what relationships or patterns you observe in the attention scores for that specific attention head in the given layer.

Finally, in the "Example Sentences:" part, you should replace "TODO" with the actual sentences you used for your analysis, and describe how the attention patterns you observed are manifested in those sentences.

The reason there are two sections in the markdown is likely because you are expected to analyze and describe the attention patterns for at least two different attention heads, possibly from different layers, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's attention mechanism.
